\section{General comments}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 1}

As noted in Section 4.2.4, the a priori assumptions do not describe reality very
well. In particular, I suspect that the information content of Dm and N0* is
highly dependent on the a priori assumptions of these two variables in the
retrieval framework. Especially with a radar measurement, since Z is sensitive
to both parameters over a wide range of the parameter space, the relative
sensitivity and therefore information content will almost entirely depend on the
relative constraints on these parameters imposed by Xa and Sa. As such it is
imperative to accurately characterize these. I understand the choice to use the
DARDAR constraints, but it’s clear from the cross-section plots that the model
ice particle concentrations vary over a much wider range than the roughly 2
orders of magnitude that Eq. 4 provides over a 220-272 K temperature range. So,
when the retrieval results are compared to model “reality”, it seems that a lot
of N0* variability is folded into Dm and this is especially evident in Figures
13 and 14. My overall concern is that it is difficult to interpret some of the
results when the model fields and the a priori assumptions differ so strongly.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

To avoid potential misunderstanding we would like to point out that the
variation of the a priori mean with temperature, which is given by Eq. 4, does
not limit the retrieved values of $N_0^*$ to this range. How much $N_0^*$ is
allowed to vary around the a priori mean is determined by the covariance matrix.
Since the standard deviation for $\text{log}_{10}(N_0^*)$ at each grid point was
set to $2$ (c.f. Tab.~3), $N_0^*$ is free to vary over several orders of
magnitude in addition to the variation of the a priori profile.

Furthermore, the sentence in Section~4.2.4 was badly formulated and did not
really express what we wanted to say there. The a priori assumptions are not
generally bad for the model (after all the averaged results for the first scene
are good). Rather, they are insufficient to accurately describe the
(co-)variability of $D_m$ and $N_0^*$.

Nonetheless, the point raised by the reviewer certainly remains valid: In
absolute terms, the interpretation of the retrieval results is dependent on the
a priori assumptions. We argue here, however, that by applying equivalent a
priori assumptions in all retrievals, we can still derive conclusions on the
benefits of the combined retrieval approach based on a relative interpretation
of the retrieval results. Our results indicate that the combined retrieval has
to rely less on a priori assumptions than the radar-only retrieval. This is
an important advantage of the combined retrieval since if $D_m$ and $N_0^*$
could be constrained reliably a priori we would not have the uncertainties in
the observational record of ice hydrometeors that we see today.

\subsubsection*{Changes in manuscript}

\begin{itemize}
\item The discussion of the role of the a priori and its impact on results has
  been extended by adding the following paragraph to the manuscript:

  \begin{change}[491]
\DIFadd{The a priori assumptions used in this study were chosen similar to those of the
DARDAR-CLOUD product, since they represent well established and validated
assumptions for ice cloud retrievals. The role of the a priori is to complement
the observations with additional information required to make the retrieval
problem tractable. For the hydrometeor retrieval this means that the a priori
determines how information from the observations, which alone is insufficient to
determine both degrees of freedom of the PSD, is distributed between its $D_m$
and $N_0^*$ parameters. For the radar-only retrieval, this works well for cloud
systems containing both ice and snow but leads to biased retrievals of both IWC
and IWP when this is not the case (}\DIFaddend Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. In general, the passive-only and the combined retrievals display }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{). The DARDAR product
uses co-located lidar observations to resolve the ambiguity where observations
from both sensors are available. As our results show, this can be achieved also
by combining a radar with passive microwave radiometers. However, while the
overlap between lidar and radar is restricted to relatively thin clouds,
microwave radiometers can provide sensitivity even deeper inside clouds.
}
  \end{change}

\item The following paragraph has been added to the discussion of the limitations of
  the study which clearly states that the retrieval results should not be
  interpreted in absolute terms:

  \begin{change}[549]
  \DIFadd{An important limitation of this study is its scope: The aim here was not to
  develop a production-ready combined retrieval product but rather a
  proof-of-concept to explore this observational approach. The retrieval results
  presented here should therefore not be interpreted in absolute terms. The
  primary results are based on the relative performances of the three retrieval
  methods: Given equivalent }\DIFaddend a priori assumptions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do
  not describe reality very well. In addition to that, the current implementation
  of the retrieval is computationally very expensive. For further development of
  the combined retrieval
  concept it may therefore be advisable to revisit the applied retrieval method in search for a potentially more suitable alternative}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, the combined retrieval
  demonstrates higher sensitivity to the microphysical properties than the
  radar-only retrieval and lower errors in terms of IWC than the passive-only
  retrieval}\DIFaddend .
  \end{change}

\item The paragraph starting on line 524 on the limitations of the OEM as
  retrieval method has been removed since its interpretation caused confusion
  and it was deemed to be of minor importance for the overall results of the study.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 2}

Forward model error is introduced when the different species present in the
model microphysics are combined into one species and when different scattering
models are used to represent the ice particles. That this is not represented in
Se could lead to over-fitting and poor convergence (I suspect this is part of
the reason why the normalized cost is much higher for the radiometer-including
retrievals). It should be relatively easy to quantify this error by re-running
the simulations with the retrieval assumptions(combining ice species, different
scattering models), and I suspect that this error term would dominate the
instrument noise term for many channels.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

It is certainly true that the simplified forward model used in the retrieval
introduces a forward modeling error and that it will likely dominate the sensor
noise. However, we do not agree with the reviewer that this error is easy to
quantify. First of all, the error will not be Gaussian and will depend on the
cloud composition and the assumed particle shape, so that a more sophisticated
error model would be required to describe the error accurately. Fitting such a
model to the test scenes would likely yield overly optimistic results as this
would mean making use of information which would not be available
for a real retrieval scenario.

Because of these difficulties, we decided to not pursue this approach in the
study. However, since this is an important point to mention, we will add a
paragraph on this issue in the discussion.

\subsubsection*{Changes in manuscript}

\begin{change}[513]
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It should be noted, that none of the presented
  retrievals accounts for the error caused by the simplified forward model and
  the choice of the particle model. This has not been pursued here because of
  the difficulty of fitting a suitable model to the forward model errors which
  are likely non-Gaussian and scene-dependent. However, it is likely that
  accounting for these errors can improve retrieval performance and weaken the
  impact of the particle choice on the retrieval results}\DIFaddend .

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 7}

7. Line 256: Actually, this is only one example of how the radar and radiometer
measurements can be complementary. Even if the lines were parallel (and thus no
information distinguishing size from concentration could be obtained), the radar
still locates the cloud and describes its vertical structure. One can imagine a
cloud of the same ice water path and particle size at two different heights
having different brightness temperatures due to changes in the water vapor
absorption above the cloud – having the radar information would provide
increased information content about the ice water pathin this case than the
radiometer measurement alone.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

It is certainly correct that when a radar sensor is added to a passive
observation system one of the advantages will be the increased resolution.
However, what we are interested in are the advantages that neither of the two
instruments can provide on its own. If it was only about vertical resolution,
then the radar alone would be the ideal observation system. In this sense, we do
not consider the vertical resolution a synergy of the two sensors.

To make this clear, we will add an explanation of our definition of synergies
between the active and passive observations to the section which discusses the
complementary information content.

\subsubsection*{Changes in manuscript}
\begin{change}[237]
A fundamental question regarding the benefit of combining two remote sensing
observations in a retrieval is to what extent the observations contain
non-redundant information. The degree of non-redundancy in the combined
observations is what we refer to here as complementary information content. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We
are thus interested in the information that cannot be provided by either of the
instruments alone. The higher resolution achieved by adding radar observations
to passive ones is therefore not considered as complementary information since
the radar alone can provide the increased resolution.

%Although this is certainly one advantage of combining radar and radiometer
%observations, we do not consider this a true synergy of the active and passive
%observations since correctly locating the cloud in the atmosphere is something
%that the radar can do alone. For the passive to add benefit to the radar, the

 Line 382: should be “reference” instead of “references”

This has been corrected in the updated version of the manuscript.

Line  414:  How  are  the  truncated  PSDs  (using  GemSnow)  represented  in  theforward simulations? Is total ice water content conserved? If so, how is it spread amongthe valid particle sizes – equally, or is the truncated mass allocated to the smallest size bin?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

Total IWC is not conserved in the handling of PSDs. The point raised by the reviewer has been
investigated by assessing the effect of the truncation on the water content of snow in the
forward simulations. The results of the analysis are given in the figure below. As these results
show, the effects of the truncation in the forward simulations are negligible.

However, when the GemSnow particle model is used in the retrieval it can
introduce significant errors. For this reason as well as another reviewers'
comment regarding the choice of tested particles, the selection of particles to
be used in the retrieval will be changed for the revised manuscript and the
GemSnow particle will be replaced by a habit mix which uses the GemSnow
particle for large diameters.

Figure 16: The figure labels/captions aren't clear if they refer to total liquid
water content/path or just the cloud liquid water/path.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

We will clarify that the contours refer to liquid cloud water content in the
revised version of the manuscript.

\subsubsection*{Changes in manuscript}

To make clear what the labels refer to, they have been changed to liquid cloud
water content (LCWC) in the figure. The new figure is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_cw_b}.

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 15}

 Line 518: It’s interesting that the Plate Aggregate provides the most accurate
 re-trieval results, even though it isn’t similar to the models used in the
 synthetic measurement simulations. Does the decreasing density with size
 better replicate the combina-tion of high-density GemCloudIce (which tends to
 be present in high concentrations atsmall sizes) and lower-density GemSnow
 (which tends to be dominant at larger sizes)?

\subsubsection*{Author response}

Unfortunately, we cannot give a definitive answer to this question. As panel (a)
in Fig. 15 shows, the density of the LargePlateAggregate habit is actually lower
than that of snow for large particle sizes. Moreover, the scattering properties
certainly also play a role here. From these results alone, we are therefore not able to
postulate any direct causality between the particle density and the performance
in the retrieval.

\subsubsection*{Changes in manuscript}

To provide more definitive recommendations regarding the choice of the particle
model, we have reconsidered the selection of models to test and added the figure
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_properties} to the manuscript. These results
indicate that a potential explanation of the good performance of the Large Plate
Aggregate is that its scattering properties are intermediate to those of
GEM cloud ice and GEM snow.
