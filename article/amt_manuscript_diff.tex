\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]


Ice \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clouds }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hydrometeors }\DIFaddend play an important role \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in many weather- and climate-related processes
in the atmosphere. They
interact with incoming and outgoing radiation and thus
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for both weather and climate. They
}\DIFaddend influence the Earth's energy budget \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Moreover, as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{through their interaction with incoming and
outgoing radiation, constitute a }\DIFaddend part of the global hydrological cycle and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due to their relation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are
coupled }\DIFaddend to the dynamics of the atmosphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bony15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in multiple ways \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bony15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Because of this}\DIFaddend , observations of ice clouds \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{provide important information
to
constrain the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are required for understanding the
role of clouds in a changing climate \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{boucher13}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, to provide information
on the dynamical }\DIFaddend state of the atmosphere in numerical weather prediction (NWP)
models \citep{geer} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as to validate predictions from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and to validate }\DIFaddend climate models \citep{waliser09}. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Despite
the importanceof observations of ice clouds for climate and weather
prediction}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Despite
this importance}\DIFaddend , today's global observing system cannot provide accurate
information on the global distribution of ice in the atmosphere
\citep{eliasson11,duncan18a}. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{main difficulty in sensing atmospheric ice from space is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{difficulty of measuring atmospheric ice using
remote sensing lies in }\DIFaddend the large variability of sizes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and concentrations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, concentrations and shapes
}\DIFaddend in which ice particles occur in the atmosphere. The wide spectrum of ice crystal
sizes, which ranges from micro- to millimeter scales, can only be partially
resolved by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{currently }\DIFdelend available space-borne sensors.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The sensitivity of a remote sensing system to ice particles of a given size is
determined mainly by its observing frequencies. The scattering of radiation by
ice particles is strongest for sizes roughly equal to the wavelength, $\lambda$,
of the radiation . For particleswith sizes much smaller than $\lambda$, the
sensitivity decreases rapidly, making them practically invisible to the sensor. Although the strength of the interaction between particles and radiation
decreases as the wavelength becomes much larger than the particle size, it
remains strong enough for the cloud signal to saturate in the presence of thicker clouds,
leading to loss of sensitivity further down the line of sight. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Current operational observation systems used to study clouds can be divided into
two groups by virtue of their observing frequency and their corresponding
capabilities and limitations. Microwave sensors employ wavelengths ranging down
to about $1\ \unit{mm}$. These very long wavelengths are sensitive only to the
very largest ice particles but provide the advantage of penetrating even thick
clouds. Optical and infrared sensors use radiation with wavelengths from around
$15\ \unit{\mu m}$ down to several hundred nano meters. Although these short
wavelengths make them sensitive to small ice particles, their signal saturates
for moderately thick clouds thus making them insensitive to the ice mass further
down the line of sight. Although radars and lidars allow detection of lower ice
water contents than their passive counterparts, they are ultimately limited by
the same principles.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The observing frequencies that are currently available for measuring ice from
space are limited to the microwave, infrared and optical domain.
Infrared and
optical sensors provide sensitivity to small ice particles but cannot sense
significant parts of the ice mass of thicker clouds due to
saturation of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The currently most accurate information on the global distribution of ice water
content (IWC) is provided by the CloudSat radar. A main strength of these
observations is their vertical resolution, in }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{signal. Microwave observations , in contrast, provide sensitivity throughout the whole atmospheric column but are insensitive to small ice particles. Although
radars and lidars generally provide greater sensitivity than their passive
counterparts, they are
ultimately limited by the same principles}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{order of 500 m. However, the
radar lacks scanning capability and the swath width is just 1.5 $\ \unit{km}$,
to be contrasted with the swath width of passive imagers which is on the order
of $1000\ \unit{km}$. A potentially less obvious limitation is that CloudSat
performs a single-frequency measurement. Since this limits the information per
range bin to one degree of freedom, a priori information is required as
additional constraints on microphysical properties such as particle size,
concentration and shape.
}

\DIFadd{A way to overcome the limitations of single-frequency radar observations is to
combine them with observations from passive sensors, which typically provide
observations at multiple frequencies and a significantly wider swath. Two types
of synergies can be distinguished for such an observation scenario: A local
synergy, which consists of using the co-located radar and radiometer
observations to obtain more accurate hydrometeor retrievals, and the non-local
synergy, which uses the vertically resolved radar observations to constrain
passive-only retrievals across the wide swath of the passive sensor. Prominent
examples of satellite missions that exploit both of these synergies are the the
Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kummerow98, grecu04}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) and the
Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hou14, grecu16, munchak11,
  kummerow15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) mission. Since the principal target of these missions are
retrievals of liquid hydrometeors, they make use of sensors at comparably low
microwave frequencies and hence provide only limited sensitivity to frozen
hydrometeors}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To narrow the size-sensitivity gap between the infrared and traditional microwave
sensors, the upcoming }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{With the upcoming launch of the }\DIFaddend Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a new passive microwave
sensor will become operational, which is dedicated to observing ice hydrometeors
from space. ICI }\DIFaddend will extend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{microwave
frequencies available for studying clouds }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{range of currently available microwave
frequencies }\DIFaddend with channels at $243$, $325$, $448$ and $664\ \unit{GHz}$

\citep{eriksson20}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. This will narrow the size-sensitivity gap between the
infrared and traditional microwave sensors by extending }\DIFaddend the smallest currently
available microwave wavelength from $1.6\ \unit{mm}$ at $183\ \unit{GHz}$ down
to the sub-millimeter domain ($0.45\ \unit{mm}$ at $664\ \unit{GHz}$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and
}\DIFaddend significantly improve the size-sensitivity of space-borne microwave observations
of clouds. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Together with ICI, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend the newly developed Microwave Imager (MWI) will be
flown on the satellites of the Metop-SG program. MWI will complement ICI's
observations with measurements at traditional millimeter wavelengths \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as well as
a novel spectral band around the $118\ \unit{GHz}$ oxygen line}\DIFaddend . The observations
of MWI, which cover the frequency range from $19\ \unit{GHz}$ up to
$183\ \unit{GHz}$, will provide additional sensitivity to liquid and frozen
precipitation as well as water vapor.

vertical distribution of ice in the atmosphere \citep{birman17, grutzun18,

and sub-millimeter radiometer observations with active observations from a cloud

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The synergistic retrieval is tested using simulated observations of cloud scenes

\subsection{Reference cloud scenes}

The cloud scenes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which are }\DIFaddend used for the testing of the retrieval were produced
by Environment and Climate Change Canada using a high-resolution NWP
configuration of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) Model
(\cite{cote98}). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For this study, we restrict ourselves to two designated, two-dimensional test
scenes, which are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}. The test scenes have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two test scenes with }\DIFaddend a horizontal resolution of $1\ \unit{km}$
and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{both extend over }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an extent of }\DIFaddend $800\ \unit{km}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
The scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were selected.The vertical resolution of the
model scenes varies between 250 and $500\ \unit{m}$ below an altitude of
$18\ \unit{km}$ and decreases steadily above that. The scenes, displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}, }\DIFaddend were chosen with the aim of covering a large range of
cloud structures and compositions so as to ensure a realistic assessment of the
retrieval. The first test scene, shown in panel (a), is located in the tropical
Pacific and contains a convective storm system in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{right }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{northern }\DIFaddend half of the scene
and its anvil that extends into the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{left halfof the scene}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{southern half}\DIFaddend . The second scene, shown in
panel (b), is located in the North Atlantic and contains an ice cloud in the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{first quarter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{southern part }\DIFaddend and a low-level, mixed-phase cloud in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{remainder of the
scene}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{northern part}\DIFaddend .

 $m = 10^{-5}\  \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$ contour for different

\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The GEM model uses \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a two-moment scheme with }\DIFaddend six types of hydrometeors to
represent clouds and precipitation \citep{milbrandtyau05}: Two classes of liquid
hydrometeors (rain and liquid cloud) and four of frozen hydrometeors (cloud ice,
snow, hail and graupel). The particle size distribution (PSD) of each
hydrometeor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{type is parametrized by its particle number concentration and mass density. The
full
particle size distribution can be prognosed from the two moments using a
species-dependent parametrization and mass-size relationship. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{class is described by a three-parameter gamma distribution. The
prognostic parameters are the slope and intercept }\DIFaddend parameters of the
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distribution, which are derived from the predicted mixing ratios and number
densities. The third PSD parameter, which defines its shape, is set to a fixed,
species-specific value. A specific }\DIFaddend mass-size \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relationship are given in Tab.~\ref{tab:species_parameters}. As
shown in the table, the masses of all ice particles in the model are
assumed to scale with a power of three,
which leads to high densities for
large particles. }%DIFDELCMD <

it requires treating a more complex co-location geometry of the nadir-pointing

polarization needs to be taken into account, the effects of which can be several
Kelvin at typical viewing angles of imaging sensors \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Sensor configuration}}
\label{sec:sensors}
\DIFadd{The sensor configuration assumed for the simulated observations includes the 11

Observations from the ICI radiometer are simulated by performing a single,
non-polarized radiative transfer simulation located at the centers of the pass
bands of each \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{double-sideband }\DIFaddend channel and averaging the resulting brightness
temperatures. For channels with multiple polarizations, only a single simulation
is performed. To compensate for this, the noise of the corresponding channel is
reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The simulated ICI channels and assumed noise
levels are presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:channels}.

\subsubsection{Radiative transfer simulations}
\label{sec:orge741b86}

All simulations presented in this study were performed using Version 2.3.1245 of
the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS, \cite{arts18}). Radar
reflectivities are computed using ARTS' built-in single-scattering radar solver\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
which provides analytic Jacobians}\DIFaddend . For the simulation of passive radiances, a
hybrid solver is used which combines the DISORT \citep{disort00} scattering
solver with the ARTS standard scheme for pencil beam radiative transfer. The
hybrid solver has been added to ARTS specifically for this study and provides
approximate, analytical Jacobians, which are required for the variational
retrievals of hydrometeors. All simulations are performed assuming an ocean
surface with emissivities calculated using the Tool to Estimate Sea‐Surface
Emissivity from Microwaves to sub‐Millimeter waves (TESSEM, \cite{prigent16}).
Polarization is neglected in all simulations performed in this study. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Particle scattering data are taken from
the ARTS scattering data base (hereafter ARTS SSDB, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{eriksson18}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
). }\DIFdelend Gaseous
absorption is modeled using the absorption models from \cite{rosenkranz93} for
$N_2$, $O_2$ and from \cite{rosenkranz98} for $H_2O$.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Single scattering data for hydrometeors are taken from ARTS single scattering
data base (ARTS SSDB, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{eriksson18}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
). The database provides scattering data
for a wide range of hydrometeor shapes including particles designed specifically
to be consistent with assumptions of the GEM microphysics scheme. It also
provides a number of predefined habit mixes, called standard habits, designed to
cover the full range of particle sizes relevant for microwave observations of
ice hydrometeors.

The temperature-dependent a priori profile for $N_0^*$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend frozen hydrometeors

where $T$ is in $\unit{K}$. The a priori profile \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend $D_m$ for frozen
hydrometeors is chosen so that the a priori \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mass density }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{IWC }\DIFaddend is equal to
$10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$. For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{liquid hydrometeors}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rain}\DIFaddend , a fixed value for $N_0^*$ of
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$10^6\ \unit{m^4}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$10^6\ \unit{m^{-4}}$ }\DIFaddend is assumed and the a priori profile for $D_m$ is
determined similarly as for frozen hydrometeors.

The a priori distributions of the 6 retrieval quantities ($N_0^*$ and $D_m$ for
frozen and liquid hydrometeors, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relative humidity $\phi$, cloud water}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RH, CLWC}\DIFaddend ) are assumed to be independent so that
the overall a priori covariance matrix $\mathbf{S}_a$ has block-diagonal
structure. Within each block, vertical correlations between the values of a
given retrieval quantity at different altitudes are assumed to be exponentially
decaying. Hence, the correlation of the values of retrieval quantity $q$ at
points $i$ and $j$ of the retrieval grid is computed as
%
\begin{align}
\left ( \mathbf{S}_{a,q} \right )_{i, j} &= \sigma_{q,i} \sigma_{q,j}
 \cdot \exp  \left ( -\frac{d(i, j)}{l_q} \right ),
\end{align}
%
where $\sigma_{q, i}$ is the a priori uncertainty assumed for retrieval
quantity $q$ at grid point $i$, $d(i, j)$ the distance between the grid
points and $l_q$ the quantity-specific correlation length. The assumed
a priori uncertainties and correlation lengths for the retrieval quantities

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Representation of ice particle shape}}
\label{sec:method:partilce_models}

\DIFadd{A major difficulty for cloud retrievals is that the observations do not provide
sufficient information to distinguish different hydrometeor species. In the
proposed retrieval algorithm, this difficulty is overcome by representing frozen
hydrometeors using only a single hydrometeor species. This, however, poses the
problem of finding a suitable representation of frozen hydrometeors that can
capture variability of the four frozen hydrometeor species in the model and
ideally also real ice hydrometeors.
}

\DIFadd{In the model scenario considered here, the differences between hydrometeor
species are mostly due to their different concentrations, sizes (c.f.
Fig.~\ref{fig:gem_psds}) and shape. Since two parameters of the PSD of frozen
hydrometeor species are retrieved, the retrieval can represent differences
between the PSDs of the different hydrometeor species. To capture the
variability in particle shape, it is possible to use habit mixes that combine
crystal shapes at small particle sizes with aggregate shapes at larger sizes.
This provides the retrieval with flexibility to represent differences between
cloud ice on the one hand and snow, graupel and hail hydrometeors on the other.
}

model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{The setup and retrieval quantities of the passive-only retrieval are similar to the combined retrieval, with the only difference being that frozen and liquid
hydrometeors are retrieved at reduced resolution. For ice, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will not be able to represent every possible configuration of mixes of the
four ice hydrometeor species in the GEM model. In particular, it remains unclear
which particle shape should be used to best represent this mixture. We therefore
choose a set consisting of multiple particle shapes and habit mixes, which will
be used in the retrieval to study the impact of the choice of the particle shape
on the retrieval results. The selected particles are listed in
Tab.~\ref{tab:particle_properties}. Three of them, GEM Cloud Ice, GEM Snow, and
GEM Graupel, correspond to the shapes present in the GEM model scenes. The GEM
Snow and Graupel habits were mixed with crystal shapes to ensure that they cover
sizes down to around $10\ \unit{\mu m}$. In addition to this, two of the habit
mixes distributed with the ARTS SSDB, Large Plate Aggregate and Large Column
Aggregate, are added to the selection to increase the coverage of the range of
scattering properties in the database. Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_properties}

cloud ice, the radiometric properties of particle shapes differ only for large
masses at the two highest frequencies considered. For low $N_0^*$ values, which
are more typical for snow, the particles' properties differ considerably at all
masses and frequencies. The dominating behavior is that the Large Column
Aggregate, Large Plate Aggregate and GEM Snow are less efficient in their
interaction with radiation. In contrast to that, GEM Graupel, Gem Hail and GEM
Cloud Ice are more efficient. However, for the lowest $N_0^*$ values at
the two highest frequencies the relative ordering of the efficiencies is
actually reversed and increases with increasing mass}\DIFaddend .

\DIFaddend \section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The first part of this section presents results from a numerical experiment that
investigates the complementary information content of the active and passive
microwave observations. Results of the combined and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{baseline }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{single-instrument
}\DIFaddend retrievals applied to the reference cloud scenes are presented in the remaining
part\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of this section}\DIFdelend .

\subsection{Complementary information content}
\label{sec:simple_cloud}

A fundamental question regarding the benefit of combining two remote sensing
observations in a retrieval is to what extent the observations contain
non-redundant information. The degree of non-redundancy in the combined
observations is what we refer to here as complementary information content. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We
are thus interested here in the information that cannot be provided by either of
the instruments alone. Because of this, we do not consider the higher resolution
achieved by adding radar observations to passive ones as complementary
information, since the radar alone can provide the increased resolution.
}

\DIFaddend In order to explore \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend complementary information content in the radar and
radiometer observations, an idealized, homogeneous cloud layer with a thickness
of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$4\ \unit{km}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$5\ \unit{km}$ }\DIFaddend located at an altitude of $10\ \unit{km}$ in a tropical
atmosphere is considered. The cloud is assumed to consist of a single species of
frozen hydrometeors represented using the PSD parametrization which is also used
in the retrieval and described in Sec.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{sec:method:fowardmodel}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:method:state_space}}\DIFaddend . As particle
model, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8-ColumnAggregate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{8-Column Aggregate }\DIFaddend (ID 8) from the ARTS SSDB is used.

The question that is addressed here is whether the combination of active and
passive observations is able to constrain both the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{horizontal and the
vertical scaling factors of the PSD }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size and concentration }\DIFaddend of the
ice particles in the cloud. To investigate this, the $N_0^*$ and $D_m$
parameters of the homogeneous cloud layer are varied and observations of the
cloud \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{layer }\DIFdelend are simulated. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure
\ref{fig:contours} displays the simulated passive cloud signal , i.e. the

\DIFadd{with $\rho$ the density of ice}\DIFaddend .

The contours of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the measured active and passive cloud signals }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\Delta T_B$ and $\text{dBZ}_\text{max}$  }\DIFaddend show the ambiguity
of the single-instrument \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{measurements }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observations }\DIFaddend with respect to the parameters of the PSD:
Along these contours the signal does not change, while the cloud composition
does. A necessary condition for a combined cloud retrieval to be able to resolve
this ambiguity is that the contours of the active and passive signals cross each
other. The panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:contours} thus provide an indication to what
extent the information in the radar measurement and the corresponding passive
radiometer channel provide complementary information on the parameters of the
PSD. Considering the panels corresponding to the MWI channels, the results show
that the observations contain complementary information only for very dense
clouds consisting of very large particles. In contrast to that, the ICI
observations exhibit crossing contours already at lower $m$ and $D_m$ values,
indicating that the complementary information content in these observations is
higher for less dense clouds consisting of smaller particles.

\subsection{Retrieval results}

To assess the performance of the combined cloud retrieval, the developed
algorithm has been applied to the two designated cloud scenes. The same
retrievals have been performed with a radar-only and a passive-only version of
the algorithm to serve as baselines for the combined retrieval. Each retrieval
was performed multiple times using \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend different ice particle models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The tested
particle shapes are listed together with the corresponding mass size relations

Tab.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab:particles_retrieval}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{tab:particle_properties}}\DIFaddend . Since the results for both test scenes are
qualitatively similar, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{not all analyses are shown for both scenes. Instead, these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{results from the second scene are provided in the
appendix. Complete results for all retrieval quantities, both scenes and all
tested particle shapes }\DIFaddend are provided as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend digital supplement to this article.

higher, on the order of 20 degrees of freedom, but the major part of it is
attributed to the $D_m$ parameter. For the combined retrieval, the total

the passive observations provides information on frozen hydrometeors. In
addition to that, a clear shift of information content from $D_m$ to $N_0^*$ can
be observed over both scenes.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The grouping into retrieval quantities furthermore reveals that the largest
increase in the information content comes from water vapor, which is not

For the $D_m$ parameter, a small decrease is observed with respect to the

the GemCloudIce particle clearly stands out due to its large mass. Except for
the fact that the GemSnow particle does not reach down to small particle sizes,
the remaining particle models have quite similar in mass-size relations. The
extreme density of the GemCloudIce particle model for large particle sizes likely
explains the bad performance observedin the results presented above. Similarly,
the bad performance of the GemSnow model in terms of retrieved IWC and IWP is likely
due to it not covering small particle sizes.

contains a region where the retrieval does not fit the observations well and

the particle shape has considerable effect on sub-millimeter observations \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

, one could hope that the retrieval results can be used to infer the prevailing ice particle type based on the how well the
retrieval can
fit the observations . Unfortunately, such clear conclusions cannot be drawn from
the results. In the first test scene, the best fit is obtained by the GemSnow,
GemCloudIce and the LargePlateAggregate particlemodels, although the GemSnow
and GemCloudIce models quite clearly yield the worst retrieval performance. For
the second scene, similar results are
observed . Here, the GemSnow particle
consistently gives the lowest $\chi^2_y$ value but comparison with
Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes} clearly shows that it does not yield the best retrieval
performance}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is also in these regions, where the fits obtained with different
particle models differ. These are both regions where the cloud is very thick and
both the radar and passive observations are likely saturated. Since these are
difficult regions for the retrieval it remains unclear whether these differences
can be related directly to the assumed particle shape. In contrast to this, the
retrieval fits the observations well in the remaining parts of the scene. The
exception is the GEM Graupel particle, for which quite significant misfits are
observed between $0$ and $1^{\circ}$ latitude}\DIFaddend .

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The principal aim of this study was to investigate the synergies between radar
and passive sub-millimeter observations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the retrieval of frozen
hydrometeors}\DIFaddend . To this end, a simplified numerical experiment has been presented,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that qualitatively }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend demonstrates the existence of complementary information in the radar and
passive microwave observations. Furthermore, a combined retrieval algorithm has
been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the synergistic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrievals }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieval }\DIFaddend and
further explore their potential as well as current limitations.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The novelty of this work lies, for one part, in the application of ICI's
sub-millimeter channels, which sets it apart from the combined retrievals
developed for the TRMM and GPM missions. For the other part, it lies in the
development of a fully-consistent variational retrieval in which all retrieval
quantities are retrieved from the observations from all sensors simultaneously.
This allows comparing the retrieval to equivalent radar-only and passive-only
configurations and therefore a direct analysis of the synergies between the
active and passive observations.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Fundamental synergies}

The experiment presented in the first part of this study aimed to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{establish }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{illustrate }\DIFaddend the
fundamental synergies of the active and passive microwave observations. It
compared the cloud signals observed by a radar, a millimeter-wave radiometer and
a sub-millimeter-wave radiometer. The results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{indicate }\DIFaddend that the combined
observations can simultaneously constrain the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{horizontal and vertical scaling of
the particle size distribution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size and concentration of
particles in the cloud}\DIFaddend . However, the complementary information content between
the active and passive observations depends on both the properties of the
observed cloud and the frequency of the observations. For the lower frequencies
considered in this study, i.e. the highest channels of the MWI radiometer, the
regions where both observations provide complementary information on the
particle size distribution of the cloud are limited to very high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mass densities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{water content
}\DIFaddend and particle sizes. It should be noted, however, that since the radar
simulations neglect multiple scattering, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the results are likely less
accurate in this region of the cloud-parameter space}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these results may not necessarily
carry over to space-borne observations}\DIFaddend . As the passive observing frequency
increases, the regions of complementary information content extend down to
smaller particle sizes and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cloud mass density}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{water content}\DIFaddend . Especially the highest-frequency
channels of the ICI radiometer can therefore be expected to provide
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{additional information on the particle size distribution of ice clouds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{complementary information to a W-band radar in a combined observation
scenario}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Combined cloud retrieval}

In the second part of the study, we have presented results from a combined,
variational cloud retrieval applied to synthetic observations from two test
scenes from a high-resolution atmosphere model. The results of the combined
retrieval were compared to that of a passive- and a radar-only version of the
retrieval algorithm. The simulated observations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed an airborne viewing
geometry and therefore }\DIFaddend neglected potential errors caused by different or
non-overlapping antenna beams as well as inhomogeneity of the atmosphere across
the beams. On the other hand, a source of forward model error was included by
applying a more complex microphysics scheme in the simulations than the one used
in the retrieval. This allows assessing the retrieval error caused by the
simplified modeling of cloud microphysics in the retrieval.

\subsubsection{Retrieval performance}

Of the three considered retrieval implementations, the passive-only retrieval
clearly performs worst in terms of retrieved IWC. It should be noted, however,
that the passive only retrieval presented here has not been fully optimized and
should therefore not be taken as representative of the potential performance of
the MWI and ICI radiometers for IWC retrievals. To ensure a fair comparison, the
retrieval uses almost the same a priori assumptions as the other two retrievals,
which in the presented case provide only very limited information on the
vertical structure of the cloud. As has been shown also by other studies, the
passive observations do provide information on the vertical distribution of ice
in the atmospheric column \citep{wang17, grutzun18}, but the information content
is limited to a few degrees of freedom. It is therefore unlikely that the
vertical resolution of the passive-only retrieval can be improved drastically
without further constraining it a priori, as it is typically done in retrievals
that use Monte Carlo integration or neural networks \citep{pfreundschuh18}.

With respect to IWP, however, the passive retrieval can perform as well or even
better than the radar-only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the combined }\DIFdelend retrieval. Furthermore, the results in
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Fig.}\DIFaddend ~\ref{fig:results_nd_a} indicate that the passive observations provide some
information on the particle number concentrations, which is not the case for the
radar observations. This in itself is an interesting result as it shows that
even when considered separately, observations from active and passive microwave
sensors should be considered complementary to each other in their information
content.

As expected, the radar-only retrieval provides much better IWC retrievals than
the passive-only version. However, the results \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the two-moment retrieval
}\DIFaddend exhibit systematic deviations from the reference values in certain regions of
the cloud. The analysis of the retrieval performance shown in
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_1},
\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_2} and \ref{fig:results_scatter_b_1} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Fig.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a} and \ref{fig:results_scatter_b} }\DIFaddend revealed that
these are caused by systematic errors in the retrieval of specific hydrometeor
species from the GEM model. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A likely explanation for this is that the priori
assumptions applied }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Interestingly, the 1M version of the radar only
retrieval did not produce the large errors in the second scene but therefore
produced systematic errors for the first test scene. This indicates that the a
priori assumptions used }\DIFaddend in the retrieval do not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fit the specific microphysical
properties of the species in the model. This hypothesis is confirmed by the
radar-retrieved number density fields shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a} and Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_scatter_a}. While the reference distribution has two
modes corresponding to ice and snow, the retrieved values are nearly the same
throughout the whole scene.
Viewed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide a sufficiently well
description of how the $D_m$ and $N_0^*$ parameters of the PSD co-vary and that
the radar-only observations alone do not constrain both of them well enough.
This is plausible also }\DIFaddend from an information content perspective \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, this
is plausible }\DIFdelend since the radar
provides only one piece of independent information at each range gate, which is
insufficient to determine the two degrees of freedom ($N_0^*$ and $D_m$) of the
PSD. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The information on the second degree of
freedom must therefore come from the a priori assumptions.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The a priori assumptions which were used in this study were similar but not
identical to what is  used in the DARDAR retrievals. Also here it should be
noted, that the presented results should not be taken to be representative for
the DARDAR product.Rather than this, the DARDAR a priori settings were chosen
since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice cloud
retrievals and therefore should provide a reasonable starting point for the
development of a combined cloud retrieval.The fact that the a priori
assumptions used in the DARDAR retrieval do not agree with the microphysical
properties of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This hypothesis is  confirmed by the radar-retrieved number density fields shown

snow\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the GEM model, does not say much about the general
validity of these assumptions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, the retrieved values are nearly the same throughout the whole scene
indicating that the observations themselves provide almost no information on
particle concentrations}\DIFaddend .

Despite \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend certain visible artifacts in the retrieved IWC field (Fig.
\ref{fig:results_a}), the analysis of the results of the combined retrieval
presented in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figs.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_1} , \ref{fig:results_scatter_a_2}
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Fig.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a} }\DIFaddend and in particular
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Fig.~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:boxes} shows that it yields, at least for most of the tested
particle models, the best retrieval performance for IWC and IWP. The benefit of
the combined observations is even more pronounced in the retrieved number
density fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a}). Here, the passive- and radar-only
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrieval }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrievals }\DIFaddend showed little to no skill in retrieving the particle number
concentrations. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The combined retrieval , however, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In contrast to this, the combined retrieval }\DIFaddend was able to
reproduce the general structure of the number concentration fields in regions

\DIFdel{Although }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Instead of relying on the a priori, }\DIFaddend the combined
retrieval can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reduce systematic errors in the retrieved
IWC and IWP, its performance can even degrade if an unrealistic particle habit
is used, as observed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{use information from the observations to constrain the cloud
microphysics, which avoids the systematic errors observed in the radar-only
retrievals.
}

\DIFadd{The a priori assumptions used in this study are similar to those of the DARDAR-CLOUD
product, since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice
cloud retrievals. The role of the a priori is to complement the observations
with additional information required to make the retrieval problem tractable.
For the hydrometeor retrieval this means that the a priori determines how the
information from the observations, which alone is insufficient to accurately
determine both degrees of freedom of the PSD, is distributed between its $D_m$
and $N_0^*$ parameters. For the radar-only retrieval, this works well for cloud
systems containing both ice and snow but leads to biased retrievals in both IWC
and IWP when this is not the case, as seen }\DIFaddend in Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In general,
the passive-only and the combined retrievals display }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Of course,
the DARDAR product also makes use of co-located lidar observations, so this 
would not effect observations where both radar and lidar overlap. However,
our results indicate that by combining radar and passive microwave observations
the microphysical properties of hydrometeors can be constrained even deeper
inside clouds, where optical or infrared sensors would not provide any
information.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Impact of the assumed particle shape}}

\DIFadd{Our experiments show a }\DIFaddend stronger sensitivity to the assumed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{particle shape
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ice particle shape
for the passive-only and the combined retrievals }\DIFaddend than the radar-only retrieval.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is plausible since the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The passive observations probe the particle at multiple frequencies and their
}\DIFaddend increased sensitivity especially of the sub-millimeter radiometer channels has
been highlighted in several studies \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{ekelund19a, fox19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{ekelund20, fox19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Given the increased sensitivity of the passive-only and combined retrieval to
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Only the combined retrieval was able to yield accurate IWC retrievals for both
test scenes for suitable choices of the particle model. However, if an
unsuitable particle shape is chosen, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assumed particle shape , it would be desirable to know which of the properties of a particle model are most critical for its representativeness. Five
different particle models were tested here: The two most dominant from
the GEM model and three additional models taken from the ARTS SSDB. The two GEM particles both showed the worst retrieval performance.For the
GemCloudIce model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{induced errors may actually outweigh
the benefits of the combined retrieval as is the case for the Large Column
Aggregate and the GEM Cloud Ice shapes (Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}). Judging from the
particle properties displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_properties}}\DIFaddend , a likely
explanation for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its bad performance is its very high density. The GemSnow model
has similar density as the 8-ColumnAggregate, but does not reach down to small
particle sizes, possibly explaining why it is unsuitable for the retrieval }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the good performance of the Large Plate Aggregate and the GEM
Graupel particle is that their properties are intermediate to those of GEM Cloud
Ice and GEM Snow, which are the dominating shapes in the test scenes. Provided
that the hydrometeors of the GEM model and their assumed particle properties are
sufficiently realistic to model real observations, this would mean that accurate
IWC retrievals can be achieved using only a single hydrometeor species with
suitable scattering properties that are intermediate to snowflake-type and
heavily rimed particles. This is in agreement with \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{ekelund20} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
who found
the Large Plate Aggregate to to yield good agreement with observations from the
GPM Microwave Imager at $190\ \unit{GHz}$}\DIFaddend .
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Nonetheless, small performance differences are observed also for the other three
models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The analysis of the residuals of the retrieval fit (Fig.~\ref{fig:misfit})
showed that the residuals for different particle shapes differ most where the
cloud is thick. Differences between different particles are observed}\DIFaddend , but no
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear connection to their mass-size relation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relationship to the retrieval accuracy in terms of IWC }\DIFaddend can be established. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This indicates that also its specific scattering properties are important factors
that determine representativeness of a particlemodel.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Furthermore, it has been briefly investigated whether the goodness of the
fit to
the observations can provide information on the suitability of
the chosen
particle model. In particular, we aimed to address the question whether the combined observations can constrain the dominant particle shape or whether a
good fit to the
observations can be obtained }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The
GEM Graupel particle, for example, yields accurate IWC retrievals but gives the
worst fit for the first test scene. A likely explanation for this is that the
retrieved IWC depends mostly on the efficiency with respect to water content of
the interaction between the particle and the radiation, whereas the retrieval
residual is likely due to the relative efficiencies at different frequencies.
Moreover, in the remaining parts of the scenes, there are no differences in the
residuals for different particles. This means that the retrieval can fit the
observations well }\DIFaddend regardless of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{applied particle model. Unfortunately, no evidence of a relation between the $\chi^2_y$ value and the retrieval performance was observed. It thus remains an open question whether
and how information on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed particle shape and indicates that
the observations alone do not constrain the particle shape. This indicates that
}\DIFaddend the ice particle shape \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can be extracted from microwave
observations of ice particles}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is not constrained by the observations and must be
determined a priori}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Humidity and cloud water}

As an outlook, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we have also included }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend results from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{liquid cloud retrieval ,
that clearly shows its capability to retrieve liquid cloud mass densities even
within mixed-phase clouds.
Although certain sensitivity to cloud water is
observed also for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LCWC retrieval have been provided.
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_cw_b} shows improvements in retrieved LCWP and LCWC in the
results of the combined retrieval compared to }\DIFaddend the passive-only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrieval, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieval.
Although also }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{addition of the radar signal
clearly improved the localization of the cloud in the atmosphere. This explains
the observed improvement in the retrieved LWP, since at lower altitude a thicker
cloud is required to yield the same passive cloud signal}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{passive-only retrieval shows sensitivity to LCWC, the results
are less stable than those of the combined retrieval}\DIFaddend . This shows that
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{combined radar
and microwave radiometer observationscan also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sub-millimeter radiometers, in particular in combination with radar
observations, can }\DIFaddend be used for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the
profiling of warm and supercooled liquid clouds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieving both frozen and liquid cloud water
content in mixed-phase clouds. This conclusion is supported by the information
content analysis in Fig.~\ref{fig:dfs}, which shows that the passive
observations provide a small amount of information on liquid clouds and that
this is increased for the combined retrieval}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although no satisfactory results were obtained from the water vapor retrieval,
the retrieval results still indicate sensitivity of this setup for retrieving
atmospheric humidity.The full exploration of the potential of the combined
observations for liquid cloud and water vapor is out of the scope of this study
and is left to future investigation.

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Limitations}}

\DIFadd{An important limitation of this study is its scope: The aim here was not to
develop a production-ready combined retrieval product but rather a
proof-of-concept to explore this observational approach. The retrieval results
presented here should therefore not be interpreted in absolute terms. The
primary results are based on the relative performances of the three retrieval
methods: Given equivalent }\DIFaddend a priori assumptions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do
not describe reality very well. In addition to that, the current implementation
of the retrieval is computationally very expensive. For further development of
the combined retrieval
concept it may therefore be advisable to revisit the applied retrieval method in search for a potentially more suitable alternative}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, the combined retrieval
demonstrates higher sensitivity to the microphysical properties than the
radar-only retrieval and lower errors in terms of IWC than the passive-only
retrieval}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \subsubsection{\DIFdel{Limitations}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{subsubsection}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Finally, it is important to consider the limitations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another limiting factor }\DIFaddend of this study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The results
presented here are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are that it is }\DIFaddend purely based on simulations
and restricted to two selected model test scenes. The validity of the presented
results thus \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to some extent
}\DIFdelend depends on how well cloud microphysics are represented in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend GEM
model. While this may \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{affect the specific performance results for the tested retrieval methods}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{again affect an interpretation of the results in absolute
terms}\DIFaddend , the main findings of this work, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{namely that the combined retrieval shows greater
sensitivity to the microphysical properties of ice hydrometeors than the radar-
or passive-only retrievals}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which are based on a relative comparison
of the retrieval results}\DIFaddend , should be independent of the realism of the test
scenes.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, the forward simulations used to generate the synthetic observations do not consider beam filling issues, assume a
slightly unrealistic viewing geometry and neglect multiple scattering in the radar simulations. For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As has been stated above, simulated observations used in this study assumed a
viewing geometry that is realistic only for airborne observations. They
therefore do not provide }\DIFaddend a realistic assessment of the potential \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrieval performance this should
certainly be taken into account . Again,
it is important to understand the
results presented here as a study of the fundamental synergies of active and
passive microwave observationsrather than an accurate performance assessment of the combined retrieval }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of a
space-borne satellite mission involving ICI, MWI and a W-band radar. For this it
would be necessary to take into account a more realistic viewing geometry,
beam-filling errors as well as multiple scattering in the radar observations.
Quantifying the effect of these error sources on the retrieval synergies is
left for future investigation}\DIFaddend .

\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
\label{sec:conclusions}

The main \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{conclusions from the results presented above are:
}%DIFDELCMD < \begin{enumerate}
%DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\DIFdel{The complementary information in active and
passive microwave observations canconstrain two degrees of freedom of the
PSD }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{conclusion from this work is that the combination of radar and
sub-millimeter radiometer observations can, to some extent, constrain both the
size and number concentration }\DIFaddend of frozen hydrometeors. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\DIFdel{This reduces systematic retrieval errors for specific hydrometeor species whose
  properties are not well described by the a priori assumptions.
}%DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\DIFdel{Especially the sub-millimeter channels of the ICI radiometer contribute to the synergistic information content for ice particles. }%DIFDELCMD < \end{enumerate}
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In addition to this}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The increased sensitivity
of the combined retrieval to the microphysical properties of hydrometeors can
increase the accuracy of IWC retrievals and avoid systematic errors observed in
an equivalent radar-only retrieval. Moreover}\DIFaddend , the combined retrieval \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also shows improved profiling capabilities
for warm and supercooled liquid clouds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{showed clear
sensitivity to the particle number density and was able reproduce its vertical
structure in regions where the cloud composition is homogeneous}\DIFaddend .

The results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{presented in this study }\DIFdelend particularly highlight the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{complementarity
of the active and passive observations: Although the radar provides observations
at high vertical resolution, they contain insufficient information on the
microphysical properties of hydrometeors. The passive-only observations , on the
contrary, have low vertical resolution, but are more sensitive to cloud
microphysics allowing a potentially more accurate IWP retrieval than what can be
obtained from the radar alone. A synergistic retrieval using both types of
observations allows combining the high vertical resolution of the radar with the
sensitivity to cloud microphysics of the passive observations, which
yields more accurate retrievals of IWC, IWP and  particle number densities}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{importance of sub-millimeter observations
for combined retrievals of frozen hydrometeors. While observations at currently
available microwave frequencies provide information complementary to that from a
radar only for thick clouds with very large particles ($D_m > 800\ \unit{\mu m},
\text{IWC} > 10^{-4}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$), frequencies above $200\ \unit{GHz}$
provide additional information on cloud microphysics (Fig.~\ref{fig:contours})
at smaller particles sizes and water content ($D_m > 200\ \unit{\mu m},
\text{IWC} > 10^{-5}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$).
}

\DIFadd{Regarding the representation of hydrometeors in the retrieval, our results
indicate that complex mixes of hydrometeors can be accurately represented
using a single, suitable habit mix. In particular, our results point towards that
a suitable habit should have scattering properties that are intermediate
between strongly rimed and  more snow-flake like particles}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Synergistic retrievals from active and passive microwave observations ideally
complement currently available observation systems that combine radar with
observations in the visible or infrared. The advantage of combined microwave
observations is that they provide sensitivity throughout the whole cloud,
where
visible and infrared observations would be saturated. Where only information
from the radar is available, a retrieval based on optical or infrared
observations has to rely on a priori assumptions, which may cause similar
systematic errors as what has been observed in this study. In addition to this, our results underline the benefits of ICI's sub-millimeter channels, which significantly improve the sensitivity of the passive observations to smaller
particle sizes and mass densities and thus narrow the sensitivity gap between
the observing frequencies of traditional microwave imagers and observations in the infrared and visible domain. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The upcoming launch of the ICI and MWI radiometers thus }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A direct application of the synergistic retrieval algorithm developed in this
study are flight campaigns involving the International Sub-millimetre Airborne
Radiometer (ISMAR, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{fox17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) combined for example with a radar on another
aircraft or the Microwave Radar/radiometer for Arctic Clouds (MiRAC,
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{mech19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
). The ability of the combined retrieval to constrain two moments
of the PSD of frozen hydrometeors should make it a valuable tool for validating
the representation of clouds in cloud-resolving or large-eddy simulations which
typically employ two-moment schemes. Moreover, since our results indicate
certain retrieval skill also for LCWC in mixed-phase clouds, such
observations can be used to study the properties of these clouds which play an
important role for the climate of the arctic.
}

\DIFadd{Ultimately, spaceborne combined radar/sub-millimeter observations can be a way
forward towards reducing the large uncertainties in the observational record of
ice hydrometeors. The MetopSG program }\DIFaddend provides a great opportunity for a
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{potential synergistic cloud-radar missions. Such a mission
would have a unique scientific value for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{synergistic radar mission involving the MWI and ICI radiometers. The results
presented here clearly show the potential this approach and can provide a first
step towards the development of a retrieval algorithm for a space-borne
configuration. This, however, will require the extending the algorithm to }\DIFaddend the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{study of frozen hydrometeors
because of its ability to better determine the
microphysical properties of
hydrometeors even inside of thick clouds. Since such information is currently
simply not available at a global scale, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more complex viewing geometry. Moreover, to quantify the potential benefits of
}\DIFaddend such a mission \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{would be valuable not
only in itself but also for other earth observation systems by establishing more
reliable a priori assumptions on cloud microphysics.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The results presented in this study not only show the potential of the combined
retrieval approach but also demonstrate its feasibility. Although further work
will be required to fully understand the effect of particle shape and PSD, the concept is mature enough to be applied to real observations. Since airborne
demonstrators of sub-millimeter radiometers are available already today, the
combined retrievals could be applied in future field campaigns to study ice
cloud microphysics. }%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{Overall, the combined active and passive microwave retrievals are a promising
concept that deserves further exploration.Regardless whether airborne or

combined active and passive microwave observations have great
potential to improve the understanding of the microphysical properties of

\section{\DIFadd{Results from second test scene}}

\DIFadd{The retrieved IWC obtained using the Large Plate Aggregate for the second scene
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_b}. Similar to the first test scene, also this
scene contains a region in the south where the final OEM cost, shown in
Panel~(a), is increased for the passive-only and combined retrievals. This is
again a region of very dense cloud consisting of graupel and snow.
Qualitatively, the results of the IWC retrieval are very similar to those from
the first scene. While the passive-only retrieval provides only very low
vertical resolution, both the radar-only and combined retrieval reproduce the
vertical structure of the cloud well. The radar-only retrieval consistently
overestimates the IWC in the scene, which is not the case for the combined
retrieval.
}

\DIFadd{Scatter plots for the retrieval results from the second scene are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_b}. Except for the lack of cloud ice in the scene,
the results are similar to what has been observed in the first scene: The
radar-only retrieval exhibits the same systematic error for the retrieval of snow as in
the first scene. Again, this is corrected by the combined retrieval for most of
the tested particle shapes. The exception are the GEM Cloud Ice and the Large
Column Aggregate particles for which the retrieval does not perform as well.
