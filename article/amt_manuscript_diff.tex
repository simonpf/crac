\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]


Ice \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clouds }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hydrometeors }\DIFaddend play an important role \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in many weather- and climate-related processes
in the atmosphere. They
interact with incoming and outgoing radiation and thus
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for both weather and climate. They
}\DIFaddend influence the Earth's energy budget \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Moreover, as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{through their interaction with incoming and
outgoing radiation, constitute a }\DIFaddend part of the global hydrological cycle and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due to their relation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are
coupled }\DIFaddend to the dynamics of the atmosphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bony15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in multiple ways \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bony15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Because of this}\DIFaddend , observations of ice clouds \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{provide important information
to
constrain the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are required for understanding the
role of clouds in a changing climate \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{boucher13}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, to provide information
on the dynamical }\DIFaddend state of the atmosphere in numerical weather prediction (NWP)
models \citep{geer} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as to validate predictions from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and to validate }\DIFaddend climate models \citep{waliser09}. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Despite
the importanceof observations of ice clouds for climate and weather
prediction}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Despite
this importance}\DIFaddend , today's global observing system cannot provide accurate
information on the global distribution of ice in the atmosphere
\citep{eliasson11,duncan18a}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The main difficulty in sensing atmospheric ice from space is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A major difficulty of measuring atmospheric ice using
remote sensing lies in }\DIFaddend the large variability of sizes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and concentrations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, concentrations and shapes
}\DIFaddend in which ice particles occur in the atmosphere. The wide spectrum of ice crystal
sizes, which ranges from micro- to millimeter scales, can only be partially
resolved by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{currently }\DIFdelend available space-borne sensors.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The sensitivity of a remote sensing system to ice particles of a given size is
determined mainly by its observing frequencies. The scattering of radiation by
ice particlesis strongest for sizes roughly equal to the wavelength, $\lambda$, of the radiation. For particleswith sizes much smaller than $\lambda$, the
sensitivity decreases rapidly, making them practically invisible to the sensor. Although the strength of the interaction between particles and radiation
decreases as the wavelength becomes much larger than the particle size, it
remains strong enough for the cloud signal to saturate in the presence of thicker clouds, leading to loss of sensitivity further down the
line of sight. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Current operational observation systems used to study clouds can be divided into
two groups by virtue of their observing frequency and their corresponding
capabilities and limitations. Microwave sensors employ wavelengths ranging down
to about $1\ \unit{mm}$. Compared to the sizes of ice particles, the wavelengths
are very long and therefore sensitive only to very large ice particles. At the
same time, they provide the advantage of penetrating even thick clouds. Optical
and infrared sensors use radiation with wavelengths from around $15\ \unit{\mu
  m}$ down to several hundred nano meters. Although these relatively short
wavelengths make them sensitive to small ice particles, their signal saturates
for thick clouds, which makes them insensitive to the ice mass further down the
line of sight. Although radars and lidars allow detection of lower ice water
contents than their passive counterparts, they are ultimately limited by the
same principles.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The observing frequencies that
are currently available for measuring ice from
space are limited to the
microwave, infrared and optical domain.
Infrared and
optical sensors provide sensitivity to small ice particles but cannot sense
significant parts of the ice mass of thicker clouds due to saturation of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The currently most accurate information on the global distribution of ice water
content (IWC) is provided by the CloudSat radar. A main strength of these
observations is their vertical resolution, in }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{signal. Microwave observations , in contrast, provide sensitivity throughout the
whole atmospheric column but are insensitive to small ice particles. Although
radars and lidars generally provide greater sensitivity than their passive
counterparts, they are ultimately limited by the same principles}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{order of 500 m. However, the
radar lacks scanning capability and the swath width is just 1.5 $\ \unit{km}$
wide, to be contrasted with the swath width of passive imagers which is on the
order of $1000\ \unit{km}$. A potentially less obvious limitation is that
CloudSat performs a single-frequency measurement. Since this limits the
information per range bin to one degree of freedom, a priori information is
required as additional constraint on microphysical properties such as particle
size, concentration and shape.
}

\DIFadd{A way to overcome the limitations of single-frequency radars is to combine them
with observations from passive sensors, which typically provide measurements at
multiple frequencies and a significantly wider swath. Two types of synergies can
be distinguished for such an observation scenario: A local synergy, which
consists of using the co-located radar and radiometer observations to obtain
more accurate hydrometeor retrievals, and the non-local synergy, which uses the
vertically resolved radar observations to support passive-only retrievals
across the wide swath of the passive sensor. Prominent examples of satellite
missions that exploit both of these synergies are the the Tropical Rainfall
Measuring Mission (TRMM, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kummerow98, grecu04, munchak11}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) and the Global
Precipitation Measurement (GPM, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hou14, grecu16, kummerow15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) mission.
Since the principal target of these missions are retrievals of liquid
hydrometeors, they make use of sensors at comparably low microwave frequencies
and hence provide only limited sensitivity to frozen hydrometeors}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To narrow the size-sensitivity gap between the infrared and traditional microwave
sensors, the upcoming }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{With the upcoming launch of the }\DIFaddend Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a new passive microwave
sensor will become operational, which is dedicated to observing ice hydrometeors
from space. ICI }\DIFaddend will extend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{microwave
frequencies available for studying clouds }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{range of currently available microwave
frequencies }\DIFaddend with channels at $243$, $325$, $448$ and $664\ \unit{GHz}$

. This extension of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{eriksson20}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. This will narrow the size-sensitivity gap between the
infrared and traditional microwave sensors by extending }\DIFaddend the smallest currently
available microwave wavelength from $1.6\ \unit{mm}$ at $183\ \unit{GHz}$ down
to the sub-millimeter domain ($0.45\ \unit{mm}$ at $664\ \unit{GHz}$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and
}\DIFaddend significantly improve the size-sensitivity of space-borne microwave observations
of clouds. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Together with ICI, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend the newly developed Microwave Imager (MWI) will be
flown on the satellites of the Metop-SG program. MWI will complement ICI's
observations with measurements at traditional millimeter wavelengths \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as well as
a spectral band around the $118\ \unit{GHz}$ oxygen line}\DIFaddend . The observations
of MWI, which cover the frequency range from $19\ \unit{GHz}$ up to
$183\ \unit{GHz}$, will provide additional sensitivity to liquid and frozen
precipitation as well as water vapor.

vertical distribution of ice in the atmosphere \citep{birman17, grutzun18,

The cloud scenes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which are }\DIFaddend used for the testing of the retrieval were produced
by Environment and Climate Change Canada using a high-resolution NWP
configuration of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) Model
(\cite{cote98}). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For this study, we restrict ourselves to two designated, two-dimensional test
scenes, which are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}. The test scenes have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two test scenes with }\DIFaddend a horizontal resolution of $1\ \unit{km}$
and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{both extend over }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an extent of }\DIFaddend $800\ \unit{km}$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were selected. The vertical resolution of the
model scenes varies between 250 and $500\ \unit{m}$ below an altitude of

Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}, }\DIFaddend were chosen with the aim of covering a large range of
cloud structures and compositions so as to ensure a realistic assessment of the
retrieval. The first test scene, shown in panel (a), is located in the tropical

also needs to be taken into account, the effects of which can be several Kelvin

Observations from the ICI radiometer are simulated by performing a single,
non-polarized radiative transfer simulation located at the centers of the pass
bands of each \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{double-sideband }\DIFaddend channel and averaging the resulting brightness

reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The simulated ICI channels and assumed noise

\subsubsection{Radiative transfer simulations}

the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS, \cite{arts18}). Radar
reflectivities are computed using ARTS' built-in single-scattering radar solver\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
which provides analytic Jacobians}\DIFaddend . For the simulation of passive radiances, a
hybrid solver is used which combines the DISORT \citep{disort00} scattering
solver with the ARTS standard scheme for pencil beam radiative transfer. The
hybrid solver has been added to ARTS specifically for this study and provides
approximate, analytical Jacobians, which are required for  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend variational
retrievals of hydrometeors. All simulations are performed assuming an ocean
surface with emissivities calculated using the Tool to Estimate Sea‐Surface
Emissivity from Microwaves to sub‐Millimeter waves (TESSEM, \cite{prigent16}).
Polarization is neglected in all simulations performed in this study. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Particle scattering data are taken from
the ARTS scattering data base (hereafter ARTS SSDB, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Single scattering data for hydrometeors are taken from ARTS single scattering

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Representation of ice particle shape}}
\label{sec:method:partilce_models}

\DIFadd{A major difficulty for cloud retrievals is that the observations may not provide
sufficient information to distinguish different hydrometeor species. Due to this
ambiguity, frozen hydrometeors in the proposed retrieval algorithm are
represented using only a single hydrometeor species. It is therefore necessary
to find a suitable representation for frozen hydrometeors, which can capture the
variability of the four frozen hydrometeor species in the GEM model and ideally also
that of real ice hydrometeors.
}

\DIFadd{The differences between hydrometeor species in the test scenes are due to their
different concentrations, sizes and shapes (c.f. Fig.~\ref{fig:gem_psds}). Since
two parameters of the PSD of frozen hydrometeor species are retrieved, the
retrieval is able to represent the characteristic number concentrations and
particle sizes of different hydrometeor species. Variations in particle shape
which correlate with particle size can be represented using a habit mix
combining crystal shapes at small sizes with aggregates or rimed particles at
larger sizes. This provides the retrieval with some flexibility to represent the
different shapes present in the test scenes.

For ice, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will not be
able to represent every possible configuration of mixes of the four ice
hydrometeor species in the GEM model. It thus remains unclear which particle
shape should be used to best represent this mixture. We therefore choose a set
consisting of multiple particle shapes and habit mixes for which we investigate
the impact of the particle choice on the retrieval results. The selected
particles are listed in Tab.~1. Three of them, GEM
Cloud Ice, GEM Snow, and GEM Graupel, correspond to the shapes present in the
GEM model scenes. The GEM Snow and Graupel habits were mixed with crystal shapes
to ensure that they cover sizes down to around $10\ \unit{\mu m}$. In addition
to this, two of the habit mixes distributed with the ARTS SSDB, the Large Plate
Aggregate and Large Column Aggregate standard habits, are included in the
selection to increase the range of scattering properties it covers.

\DIFadd{For high values of $N_0^*$, which are typical for cloud ice, the radiometric
properties of particle shapes differ only for large masses at the two highest
frequencies considered. For low $N_0^*$ values, which are more typical for snow,
the particles' properties differ considerably at all masses and frequencies. At
the two lowest frequencies, the Large Column Aggregate, Large Plate Aggregate
and GEM Snow are the least efficient scatterers or absorbers of radiation
whereas GEM Graupel, Gem Hail and GEM Cloud Ice are more efficient. This
behavior is also observed at the two higher frequencies, except for the lowest
$N_0^*$ value for which a reversal of the ordering occurs as the bulk mass
increases. The mass backscattering efficiency at $94\ \unit{GHz}$ shows the
greatest relative variability across different bulk water contents and $N_0^*$
values, spanning six orders of magnitudes, while for the mass attenuation
coefficients at the other frequencies the variability spans at most three orders
of magnitude.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The first part of this section presents results from a numerical experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which
}\DIFaddend investigates the complementary information content of the active and passive
microwave observations. Results of the combined and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{baseline }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{single-instrument
}\DIFaddend retrievals applied to the reference cloud scenes are presented in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{remaining partof this section}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{second
part}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Complementary information content}
\label{sec:simple_cloud}

A fundamental question regarding the benefit of combining two remote sensing
observations in a retrieval is to what extent the observations contain
non-redundant information. The degree of non-redundancy in the combined
observations is what we refer to here as complementary information content. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We
are thus interested in the information that cannot be provided by either of the
instruments alone. The higher resolution achieved by adding radar observations
to passive ones is therefore not considered as complementary information since
the radar alone can provide the increased resolution.
}

\DIFaddend In order to explore \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend complementary information content in the radar and
radiometer observations, an idealized, homogeneous cloud layer with a thickness
of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$4\ \unit{km}$ located }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$5\ \unit{km}$ centered }\DIFaddend at an altitude of $10\ \unit{km}$ in a tropical
atmosphere is considered. The cloud is assumed to consist of a single species of
frozen hydrometeors represented using the PSD parametrization which is also used
in the retrieval and described in Sec.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{sec:method:state_space}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:method:state_space}}\DIFaddend . As particle
model, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8-ColumnAggregate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{8-Column Aggregate }\DIFaddend (ID 8) from the ARTS SSDB is used.

The question that is addressed here is whether the combination of active and
passive observations is able to constrain both the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{horizontal and the
vertical scaling factors of the PSD }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size and concentration }\DIFaddend of the
ice particles in the cloud. To investigate this, the $N_0^*$ and $D_m$
parameters of the homogeneous cloud layer are varied and observations of the
cloud \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{layer }\DIFdelend are simulated. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure
\ref{fig:contours} displays the simulated passive cloud signal , i.e. the

the relation

\DIFdel{m = \frac{\pi \rho}{4 ^ 4}N_0^* D_m^4.
}\end{eqnarray*}

\DIFdel{In the figure, the cloud signal is displayed in $D_m$-mass density space and
thus shows how the measured passive cloud signal varies with the horizontal and
vertical scaling parameters of
the PSD.
Overlaid onto }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The cloud signal in the radiometer observations is the
difference between the cloudy- and clear-sky brightness temperatures ($\Delta

\subsection{Retrieval results}

To assess the performance of the combined cloud retrieval, the developed
algorithm has been applied to the two designated cloud scenes. The same
retrievals have been performed with a radar-only and a passive-only version of
the algorithm to serve as baselines for the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{evaluation of the }\DIFaddend combined
retrieval. Each retrieval was performed multiple times using \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend different ice
particle models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The tested
particle shapes are listed together with the corresponding mass size relations
and ARTS SSDB identifier }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{listed }\DIFaddend in Tab.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend . Since the results
for both test scenes are qualitatively similar, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{not all analyses are shown for both scenes. Instead, these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{results from the second scene
are provided in App.~\ref{app:results_b}. Complete results for all retrieval quantities,

produces systematic errors for the first scene. The passive-only retrieval
yields the largest errors in terms of retrieved IWC due its low vertical

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Compared in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In }\DIFaddend terms of IWP, however, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{results are different.

deviations observed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend IWC persist. This leads, particularly for the second

\subsubsection{Particle number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{densities}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{concentrations}\DIFaddend }

Particle number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{densities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{concentrations }\DIFaddend of frozen hydrometeors have been derived from the
retrieved $N_0^*$ and $D_m$ parameters by computing the zeroth moment of the
corresponding PSD. The resulting particle number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{density }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{concentration }\DIFaddend fields are displayed
together with the reference field in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a}. To simplify
the comparison\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{number densities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, number concentrations }\DIFaddend are displayed only where the corresponding
reference or retrieved IWC is larger than $10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$.

Comparing the passive-only and the radar-only retrieval to the reference \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{field
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fields
}\DIFaddend shows that both methods have little to no skill in predicting number 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{density
}\DIFdelend concentrations. Although the passive-only retrieval partly captures the gradient
between very high concentrations at the top of the cloud and the low
concentrations at the bottom, it is not at all resolved in the radar-only
retrieval.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The combined retrieval , however, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{In contrast to this, the combined retrieval }\DIFaddend manages to reproduce this gradient
in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{some }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most }\DIFaddend parts of the scene. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although its exact structure is not fully
reproduced, this clearly shows sensitivity of the retrievals to particle number
concentrations.

$3\unit{^\circ \ N}$ }\DIFaddend latitude. Here, the results strongly underestimate the true
number concentrations. Comparison with the cloud composition displayed in Panel
(a) of Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} shows that this region contains large amounts of
both cloud ice and snow. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend retrieval uses only a single hydrometeor species to
represent ice in the atmosphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and is therefore }\DIFaddend not able to represent such
heterogeneous conditions. Since snow will have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend stronger impact on the
observations, the retrieval in these regions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tends to predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will likely tend to represent }\DIFaddend snow
rather than ice, which leads to the low retrieved number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{densities}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{concentrations}\DIFaddend .

the GemCloudIce particle clearly stands out due to its large mass. Except for
the fact that the GemSnow particle does not reach down to small particle sizes,
the remaining particle models have quite similar in mass-size relations. The
extreme density of the GemCloudIce particle model for large particle sizes likely
explains the bad performance observedin the results presented above. Similarly,
the bad performance of the GemSnow model in terms of retrieved IWC and IWP is likely
due to it not covering small particle sizes.

fit the observations . Unfortunately, such clear conclusions cannot be drawn from
the results. In the first test scene, the best fit is obtained by the GemSnow,

directly to the assumed particle shape. In contrast to this, the retrieval fits
the observations well in the remaining parts of the scene. The exception is the

clouds even when they overlap with ice clouds. Although some sensitivity of the passive-only retrieval to LWC can be observed as well, the retrieval puts the

retrievals successfully retrieve IWC and LCWC. At the center of the scene both
retrievals fail to retrieve the LCWC. The reason for this is that in these
regions rain is present, whose signal likely swamps any signal from the liquid
cloud droplets}\DIFaddend .

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The principal aim of this study was to investigate the synergies between radar
and passive sub-millimeter observations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the retrieval of frozen
hydrometeors}\DIFaddend . To this end, a simplified numerical experiment has been presented,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that qualitatively }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend demonstrates the existence of complementary information in the radar and
passive microwave observations. Furthermore, a combined retrieval algorithm has
been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the synergistic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrievals }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieval }\DIFaddend and
further explore their potential as well as current limitations.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The novelty of this work for lies, in part, in the application of ICI's
sub-millimeter channels, which sets it apart from the combined retrievals
developed for the TRMM and GPM missions. Moreover, the development of a fully
consistent variational retrieval in which all retrieval quantities are retrieved
simultaneously using the observations from all sensors is also novel. This
allows comparison of the combined retrieval to equivalent radar-only and
passive-only configurations and therefore a direct analysis of the synergies
between the active and passive observations.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Fundamental synergies}

The experiment presented in the first part of this study aimed to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{establish }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{illustrate }\DIFaddend the
fundamental synergies of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend active and passive microwave observations. It compared
the cloud signals observed by a radar, a millimeter-wave radiometer and a
sub-millimeter-wave radiometer. The results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{indicate }\DIFaddend that the combined
observations can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simultaneously constrain the horizontal and vertical scaling of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{constrain }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{particle size distribution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size and concentration of particles in the cloud}\DIFaddend .
However, the complementary information content between the active and passive
observations depends on both the properties of the observed cloud and the
frequency of the observations. For the lower frequencies considered in this
study, i.e. the highest \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{frequency }\DIFaddend channels of the MWI radiometer, the regions
where both observations provide complementary information on the particle size
distribution of the cloud are limited to very high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mass densities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{water content }\DIFaddend and particle
sizes. It should be noted, however, that since the radar simulations neglect
multiple scattering, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the results are likely less
accurate in this region of the cloud-parameter space}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these results may not fully carry over to space-borne
observations}\DIFaddend . As the passive observing frequency increases, the regions of
complementary information content extend down to smaller particle sizes and
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cloud mass density}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{water content}\DIFaddend . Especially the highest-frequency channels of the ICI radiometer
can therefore be expected to provide \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{additional information on the particle size distribution of ice clouds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{complementary information to a W-band radar
in a combined observation scenario}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Combined cloud retrieval}

In the second part of the study, we have presented results from a combined,
variational cloud retrieval applied to synthetic observations from two test
scenes from a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{high-resolution atmosphere model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CRM}\DIFaddend . The results of the combined retrieval were compared to that
of a passive- and a radar-only version of the retrieval algorithm. The simulated
observations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed an airborne viewing geometry and therefore }\DIFaddend neglected
potential errors caused by different or non-overlapping antenna beams as well as
inhomogeneity of the atmosphere across the beams. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{On the other hand, a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A }\DIFaddend source of forward model
error was included by applying a more complex microphysics scheme in the
simulations than the one used in the retrieval. This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{allows assessing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{permits assessment of }\DIFaddend the
retrieval error caused by the simplified modeling of cloud microphysics in the
retrieval.

\subsubsection{Retrieval performance}

Of the three considered retrieval implementations, the passive-only retrieval
clearly performs worst in terms of retrieved IWC. It should be noted, however,
that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{passive only }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{passive-only }\DIFaddend retrieval presented here has not been fully optimized and
should therefore not be taken as representative of the potential performance of
the MWI and ICI radiometers for IWC retrievals. To ensure a fair comparison, the
retrieval uses almost the same a priori assumptions as the other two retrievals,
which in the presented case provide only very limited information on the
vertical structure of the cloud. As has been shown also by other studies, the
passive observations do provide information on the vertical distribution of ice
in the atmospheric column \citep{wang17, grutzun18}, but the information content
is limited to a few degrees of freedom. It is therefore unlikely that the
vertical resolution of the passive-only retrieval can be improved drastically
without further constraining it a priori, as it is typically done in retrievals
that use Monte Carlo integration or neural networks \citep{pfreundschuh18}.

With respect to IWP, however, the passive retrieval can perform as well or even
better than the radar-only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the combined }\DIFdelend retrieval. Furthermore, the results in
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Fig.}\DIFaddend ~\ref{fig:results_nd_a} indicate that the passive observations provide some
information on the particle number concentrations, which is not the case for the
radar observations. This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in itself is an interesting result as it shows that even when considered separately, observations from active and passive microwave sensors should be considered complementary to each other in their
information content}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shows that passive observations at multiple frequencies
can actually constrain the microphysics better than single-frequency radar-only
observations alone although at a much lower vertical resolution}\DIFaddend .

As expected, the radar-only retrieval provides much better IWC retrievals than
the passive-only version. However, the results \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the two-moment retrieval
}\DIFaddend exhibit systematic deviations from the reference values in certain regions of
the cloud. The analysis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the
retrieval performance shown in Figure~7,
8 and
10 revealed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a} and
\ref{fig:results_scatter_b} reveals }\DIFaddend that these are caused by systematic errors
in the retrieval of specific hydrometeor species from the GEM model.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A likely explanation for this is that the priori
assumptions applied }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Interestingly, the 1M version of the radar-only retrieval did not produce the
large errors in the second scene but produces systematic errors for the first
test scene. This indicates that the a priori assumptions used }\DIFaddend in the retrieval
do not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fit the specific microphysical
properties of the species in the model. This hypothesis is confirmed by the
radar-retrieved number density fields shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a} and Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_scatter_a}. While the reference distribution has two
modes corresponding to ice and snow, the retrieved values are nearly the same
throughout the whole scene. Viewed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide a sufficiently good description of how the $D_m$ and $N_0^*$
parameters of the PSD co-vary and that the radar-only observations alone do not
constrain both of them well enough. This is plausible also }\DIFaddend from an information
content perspective \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, this
is plausible }\DIFdelend since the radar provides only one piece of independent
information at each range gate, which is insufficient to determine the two
degrees of freedom ($N_0^*$ and $D_m$) of the PSD. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The information on the second degree of
freedom must therefore come from the a priori assumptions.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The a priori assumptions which were used in this study were similar but not
identical to what is used in the DARDAR retrievals. Also here it should be
noted, that the presented results should not be taken to be representative for
the DARDAR product.Rather than this, the DARDAR a priori settings were chosen
since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice cloud
retrievals and therefore should provide a reasonable starting point for the
development of a combined cloud retrieval.The fact that the a priori
assumptions used in the DARDAR retrieval do not agree with the
microphysical
properties of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This hypothesis is confirmed
by the radar-retrieved number concentration fields shown in

does not say much about the general
validity of these assumptions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
the retrieved values are nearly the same throughout the whole scene indicating
that the observations themselves provide almost no information on particle
concentrations}\DIFaddend .

Despite \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend certain visible artifacts in the retrieved IWC field (Fig.
\ref{fig:results_a}), the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analysis of the results of the combined retrieval presented in Figs.~7 , 8
and in particular \ref{fig:boxes} shows that it yields , at least for most of the

for IWC and IWP \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes} given that a suitable particle model is used}\DIFaddend . The benefit
of the combined observations is even more pronounced in the retrieved number
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{density fields }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{concentrations }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a}). Here, the passive- and radar-only
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrieval showed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrievals show }\DIFaddend little to no skill in retrieving the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{particle }\DIFdelend number concentrations. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The combined retrieval , however, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In

structure of the number concentration \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fields }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{field }\DIFaddend in regions where the cloud

}

\DIFadd{The a priori assumptions used in this study were chosen similar to those of the
DARDAR-CLOUD product since they represent well established and validated
assumptions for ice cloud retrievals. The role of the a priori is to complement
the observations with additional information required to make the retrieval
problem tractable. For the hydrometeor retrieval this means that the a priori
determines how information from the observations, which alone is insufficient to
determine both degrees of freedom of the PSD, is distributed between its $D_m$
and $N_0^*$ parameters. For the radar-only retrieval, this works well for cloud
systems containing both ice and snow but leads to biased retrievals of both IWC
and IWP when this is not the case (}\DIFaddend Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. In general, the passive-only and the combined retrievals display }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{). The DARDAR product
uses co-located lidar observations to resolve the ambiguity where observations
from both sensors are available. As our results show, this can be achieved also
by combining a radar with passive microwave radiometers. However, while the
overlap between lidar and radar is restricted to relatively thin clouds,
microwave radiometers can provide sensitivity even inside thick clouds.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Impact of the assumed particle shape}}

\DIFadd{Our experiments show a }\DIFaddend stronger sensitivity to the assumed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{particle shape
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ice particle shape
for the passive-only and the combined retrievals }\DIFaddend than the radar-only retrieval.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is plausible since the increased sensitivity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The passive observations probe the particle at multiple frequencies and their
sensitivity to particle shape, }\DIFaddend especially of the sub-millimeter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{radiometer channels}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{channels, }\DIFaddend has
been highlighted in several studies \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{ekelund19, fox19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{ekelund20, fox19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Given the increased sensitivity of the passive-only and combined retrieval to
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Only the combined retrieval was able to yield accurate IWC retrievals for both
test scenes for suitable choices of the particle model. However, if an
unsuitable particle shape is chosen, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assumed particle shape , it would be desirable to know which of the properties of a particle model are most critical for its representativeness. Five
different particle models were tested here: The two most dominant from
the GEM model and three additional models taken from the ARTS SSDB. The two GEM particles both showed the worst retrieval performance.For the
GemCloudIce model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{induced errors may actually outweigh
the benefits of the combined retrieval as is the case for the Large Column
Aggregate and the GEM Cloud Ice shapes (Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}). Judging from the
particle properties displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_properties}}\DIFaddend , a likely
explanation for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its bad performance is its very high density. The GemSnow model
has similar density as the
8-ColumnAggregate, but does not reach down to small
particle sizes, possibly explaining why it is unsuitable for the retrieval }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the good performance of the Large Plate Aggregate and the GEM
Graupel particle is that their properties are intermediate to those of GEM Cloud
Ice and GEM Snow, which are the dominating shapes in the test scenes. For the
test scenes considered here, this means that accurate IWC retrievals can be
achieved using only a single hydrometeor species with suitable scattering
properties which are intermediate to snowflakes and heavily rimed particles.
This is in agreement with \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{ekelund20} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
who found the Large Plate Aggregate
 to yield good agreement with observations from the GPM Microwave Imager at
$183.31 \pm 7\ \unit{GHz}$}\DIFaddend .
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Nonetheless, small performance differences are observed also for the other three
models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The analysis of the residuals of the retrieval fit (Fig.~\ref{fig:misfit})
showed that the residuals for different particle shapes differ most where the
cloud is thick. Differences between different particles are observed}\DIFaddend , but no
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear connection to their mass-size relation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relationship to the retrieval accuracy in terms of IWC }\DIFaddend can be established. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This indicates that also its specific scattering properties are important factors
that determine representativeness of a particlemodel.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The
GEM Graupel particle, for example, yields accurate IWC retrievals but gives the
worst fit for the first test scene. A likely explanation for this is that the
retrieved IWC depends mostly on the efficiency with respect to water content of
the interaction between the particle and the radiation, whereas the retrieval
residual is likely due to the relative efficiencies at different frequencies.
Moreover, in the remaining parts of the scenes, there are no differences in the
residuals for different particles. This means that the retrieval can fit the
observations well regardless of the assumed particle shape and indicates that
the observations alone do not strongly constrain the particle shape. This 
makes it unlikely that particle shape can be retrieved from observations,
thus requiring it to be determined a priori.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, it has been briefly investigated whether the goodness of the
fit to
the observations can provide information on the suitability of
the chosen
particle model. In particular, we aimed to address the question whether the combined observations can constrain the
dominant particle shape or whether a
good fit to the observations can be obtained regardless of the applied }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It should be noted, that none of the presented retrievals accounts for the error
caused by the simplified forward model and the choice of the }\DIFaddend particle model.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unfortunately, no evidence of a relation between the $\chi^2_y$ value and the retrieval performance
was observed. It thus remains an open question whether
and how information on the ice particle shape can be extracted from microwave
observations of ice particles}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This has not been pursued here because of the difficulty of fitting a suitable
error model to these errors, which are likely non-Gaussian and scene-dependent.
However, it is likely that accounting for them can improve retrieval performance
and weaken the impact of the particle choice on the retrieval results}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Humidity and cloud water}

As an outlook, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we have also included }\DIFdelend results from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{liquid cloud retrieval ,
that clearly shows its capability to retrieve liquid cloud mass densities even
within mixed-phase clouds. Although certain sensitivity to cloud water is
observed also for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{LCWC retrieval have been provided despite it not
being a focus of this study. Fig.~\ref{fig:results_cw_b} shows improvements in
retrieved LCWP and LCWC in the results of the combined retrieval compared to }\DIFaddend the
passive-only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrieval, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieval. Although also }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{addition of the radar signal
clearly improved the localization of the cloud in the atmosphere. This explains
the observed improvement in the retrieved LWP, since at lower altitude a thicker
cloud is required to yield the same passive cloud signal}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{passive-only retrieval shows
sensitivity to LCWC, the results are less robust than those of the combined
retrieval}\DIFaddend . This shows that combined \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{radar and microwave radiometer observationscan also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{millimeter and sub-millimeter radiometers,
in particular in combination with radar observations, can }\DIFaddend be used for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the
profiling of warm and supercooled liquid clouds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieving
both frozen and liquid cloud water content in mixed-phase clouds. This
conclusion is supported by the information content analysis in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dfs}, which shows that the passive observations provide some
information on LCWC and that this is increased slightly for the combined retrieval}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although no satisfactory results were obtained from the water vapor retrieval,
the retrieval results still indicate sensitivity of this setup for retrieving
atmospheric humidity.The full exploration of the potential of the combined
observations for liquid cloud and water vapor is out of the scope of this study
and is left to future investigation.

\DIFdel{Finally, it is important to consider the limitations of this study . The results
presented here are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Moreover, this study is }\DIFaddend purely based on simulations and restricted to two
selected model test scenes. The validity of the presented results thus \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to some extent

on how well cloud microphysics are represented in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend GEM model. While this may
affect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the specific performance results for the tested retrieval methods}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interpretation of the results in absolute terms}\DIFaddend , the main findings of

The increased sensitivity of the combined observations to the microphysical
properties of hydrometeors helps to improve the accuracy of IWC retrievals and
avoid systematic errors observed in an equivalent radar-only retrieval

The results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{presented in this study }\DIFdelend particularly highlight the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{complementarity
of the active and passive observations
: Although the radar provides observations at high vertical resolution, they contain insufficient information on the
microphysical properties of hydrometeors . The passive-only observations, on the contrary, have low vertical resolution, but are more sensitive to cloud

\text{IWC} > 10^{-4}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$), frequencies above $200\ \unit{GHz}$
provide additional information on cloud microphysics (Fig.~\ref{fig:contours})
at smaller particles sizes and water content ($D_m > 200\ \unit{\mu m},

}

\DIFadd{Regarding the representation of hydrometeors in the retrieval, our results
indicate that complex mixes of hydrometeors can be accurately represented using
a single, suitable habit mix. In particular, our results indicate that a
suitable habit should have scattering properties that are intermediate between
strongly rimed and more snow-flake like particles
(Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_properties}, \ref{fig:boxes}).

\DIFadd{A direct application of the synergistic retrieval algorithm developed in this

the representation of clouds in cloud-resolving or large-eddy simulations which
typically employ two-moment schemes. Moreover, since our results indicate
retrieval skill also for LCWC in mixed-phase clouds, such observations can be

\DIFdel{Synergistic retrievals from active and passive microwave observations ideally

observations is that they provide sensitivity throughout the whole cloud, where
visible and infrared observations would be saturated. Where only information
from the radar is available, a retrieval based on optical or infrared
observations has to rely on a priori assumptions, which may cause similar
systematic errors as what has been observed in this study. In addition to this,
our results underline the benefits of ICI's sub-millimeter channels, which
significantly improve the sensitivity of the passive observations to smaller
particle sizes and mass densities and thus narrow the sensitivity gap between
the observing frequencies of traditional microwave imagers and observations in
the infrared and visible domain}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is also a promising indication for combined ICI/MWI retrievals}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The upcoming launch of the ICI and MWI radiometers thus provides a great

radar mission involving the MWI and ICI radiometers. Alternatively, the
combination could be realized also by a dedicated small mission, such as the
Earth's NexT-generation ICE mission (ENTICE) described in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\section{\DIFadd{Results from second test scene}}
\label{app:results_b}

\DIFadd{The retrieved IWC obtained using the Large Plate Aggregate for the second scene
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_b}. Just as the first scene, this test scene
contains a region in the south where the final OEM cost, shown in Panel~(a), is
increased for the passive-only and combined retrievals. This is again a region
of very dense cloud consisting of graupel and snow. Qualitatively, the results
of the IWC retrieval are very similar to those from the first scene. While the
passive-only retrieval provides only very low vertical resolution, both the
radar-only and combined retrieval reproduce the vertical structure of the cloud
well. The radar-only retrieval consistently overestimates the IWC in the scene,
which is not the case for the combined retrieval.
}

\DIFadd{Scatter plots for the retrieval results from the second scene are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_b}. Except for the lack of cloud ice in the scene,
the results are similar to what has been observed in the first scene: The
radar-only retrieval exhibits the same systematic error for the retrieval of snow as in
the first scene. Again, this is corrected by the combined retrieval for most of
the tested particle shapes. The exception are the GEM Cloud Ice and the Large
Column Aggregate particles for which the retrieval does not perform as well.
