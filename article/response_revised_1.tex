\section{General comments}

\subsection*{Reviewer comment 1}

The revised manuscript is vastly improved and my concerns have mostly been
satisfied in these revisions. I agree that recasting the measurements as
airborne is an appropriate way to simplify the radiative transfer assumptions
and demonstrate the concept. My second comment, about the inclusion of forward
model error, is not directly addressed though changes in the methods but I do
agree with the author response that such an error would be scene-dependent and
therefore not trivial. However, I think the appropriate caveats have been
mentioned in the interpretation of results so as to not interpret the combined
or radiometer-only methods as being poor compared to the radar due to the higher
chi-squared(y) - in fact, it is noted that the radar is instead overfitting the
measurements.

I only found a few instances of inconsistent nomenclature (e.g., capitalization
of GEM on line 252) that should be corrected prior to publication.

\subsubsection*{Author response}

We would like to thank the auto for pointing out the inconsistencies in nomenclature, which
we will correct in the revised version of the manuscript.
